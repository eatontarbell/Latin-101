Translation Into English: 
Hercules killed Antaeus, son of the earth, in Libya. Here he was killing guests; he killed him while struggling. He slew Cygnus, the son of Mars, with his arms. Mars came and contended with him with arms for his son's sake, but Jupiter sent a thunderbolt between them. Hesione's whale was attached to Troy. He killed him; Laomedon, the father of Hesiones, because he did not return her, he killed with an arrow.
