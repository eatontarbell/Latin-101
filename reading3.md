B: Translation.

When the Greeks had been in Troy for ten years, Epeus made a wooden horse of amazing size. Menelaus, Ulysses, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, and Neoptolemus gathered in it. And on the horse they wrote, "THE GREEKS GAVE A GIFT TO MINERVA", and transferred the military camp of Tenedos. When the Trojans saw this, Priam led the horse into the temple of Minerva. When Cassandra said that the horse held enemies, they did not believe her and they put the horse in front of the temple. The Greeks went out and killed the guards and took possession of Troy.
