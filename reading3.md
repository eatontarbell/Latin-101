B: Translation.

When Achivi had been ten years in Troy, Epeus made a wooden horse of wonderful size. In that collection are Menelaus, Ulysses, Diomedes, Thessander, Sthenelus, Acamas, Thoas, Machaon, and Neoptolemus. and on the horse they wrote, "DANAI GAVE A GIFT TO MINERVA, and transferred the camp to Tenedo." When the Trojans saw this, Priam led the horse into the temple of Minerva. When Cassandra said that the enemy had a horse, they did not believe her and they put the horse as a temple. They went out to Achīvī and killed the guards and took possession of Troy.
