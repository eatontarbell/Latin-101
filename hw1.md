A regular Latin verb has four principal parts.
The first and third principal parts are finite verb forms. The first and third principal parts use present tense (person) and singular (number).
Latin and English are similar in the sense that they are both able to create phrasal verbs, but they do it differently. In Latin, interficiō means "to kill" and is a compound of the word faciō which means "to do." The words have different meanings but they are only different because principal parts were added to faciō. In English, you often need to modify the sentence structure in order to change the meaning of the word. It is difficult to make the word "do" mean something different unless you put it into a different context or phrase (as the prompt suggested, "do away with someone" means something very different from when you "do" something). In terms of the principal parts of interficiō and faciō, they are the generally same in that they drop a similar amount of letters depending on which principal part you need (for example, both interficiō and faciō drop the "io" and add "ĕre" for the second principal part). This is what enables the prefix "inter" to be added: the two words will always mirror each in terms of which letters they drop when adhearing to the guidlines of a given principal part.
