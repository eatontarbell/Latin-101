A regular Latin verb has four principal parts.
The first and third principal parts are finite verb forms. The first and third principal parts use present tense (person) and singular (number).
Latin and English are similar in the sense that they are both able to create phrasal verbs, but they do it differently. In Latin, interficiō means "to kill" and is a compound of the word faciō which means "to do." The words have different meanings but they are only different because principal parts were added to it. In English, you often need to modify the sentence structure in order to change the meaning of the word. It is difficult to make the word "do" mean something different unless you put it into a different context or phrase (as the prompt suggested, "do away with someone" means something very different from when you "do" something).
