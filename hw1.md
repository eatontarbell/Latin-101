A regular Latin verb has four principal parts.
The first and third principal parts are finite verb forms. The first and third principal parts use present tense (person) and singular (number).
Latin and English are similar in the sense that they are both able to create phrasal verbs, but they do it differently. In Latin, interficiō means "to kill" and is a compound of the word faciō which means "to do." The words have different meanings but they are only different because principal parts were added to faciō. In English, you often need to modify the sentence structure in order to change the meaning of the word. It is difficult to make the word "do" mean something different unless you put it into a different context or phrase (as the prompt suggested, "do away with someone" means something very different from when you "do" something). In terms of the principal parts of interficiō and faciō, the first, second, and third parts are the same because interficiō and faciō drop the same letters, then add the same ones appropriate to the principal part. The fourth one is different because there is one letter different: interficiō becomes interfectus while faciō becomes factus. The endings look similar, but interficiō's addition has an e while faciō's has an a.
